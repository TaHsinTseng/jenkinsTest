# Jenkins Test
This repo is for testing Jenkins pipeline. As the main purpose of this project is to get used to Jenkins, the code and files used for the project are simple and sometime meaningless.

For window nodes, 'bat' should be presented before every steps. Otherwise, Jenkins cannot understand the syntax of the jenkinsfile. 

As for linux-like system, 'sh' should be used instead.
